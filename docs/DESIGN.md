# Design Principles & Guidelines: Bookshelf Recommender

This document outlines the design philosophy, UI/UX principles, and style guidelines for the application.

## 1. Design Philosophy

- **Simplicity First**: The core workflow (upload -> analyze -> recommend) should be intuitive and require minimal user effort.
- **Visually Engaging**: Representing physical books digitally should be aesthetically pleasing and informative.
- **Discovery-Oriented**: The design should encourage exploration of recommendations and related book information.
- **Trustworthy AI**: Clearly communicate the AI's role and provide feedback during processing, managing expectations about accuracy.
- **Community Focused (Future)**: Design should foster a sense of shared experience and easy interaction between users.

## 2. UI/UX Principles

- **Clarity**: Interface elements and information hierarchy should be clear and easy to understand.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent layout, typography, color palettes, and interaction patterns across the application.
- **Feedback**: Provide immediate and clear feedback for user actions (e.g., file selection, button clicks, loading states, errors).
- **Efficiency**: Minimize the number of steps required to achieve the core goal.
- **Accessibility**: Strive for WCAG compliance, considering color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure a seamless experience across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## 3. Style Guide (Initial Notes)

- **Color Palette (Current - from App.css):**
    - Primary: `#4a6fa5` (Blue)
    - Secondary: `#166088` (Darker Blue)
    - Accent: `#4daa57` (Green)
    - Background: `#f8f9fa` (Very Light Gray)
    - Grays: `#e9ecef` (Light), `#ced4da` (Medium), `#6c757d` (Dark)
    - Text: `#343a40` (Dark Gray/Black)
    - Error: `#d9534f` (Red)
- **Typography:**
    - Font Family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif (Consider exploring more distinct web fonts like Inter, Lato, or Nunito later).
    - Hierarchy: Use distinct font sizes and weights for headers (h1, h2, h3), body text, labels, and captions.
- **Layout:**
    - Max Width: 1200px container for main content.
    - Spacing: Use consistent padding and margins (leverage CSS variables or a utility class system later).
    - Grid System: Use CSS Grid (as implemented for recommendations) and Flexbox for layout structure.
- **Components (Current):**
    - Buttons (Primary, Secondary/Camera, Accent/Analyze)
    - File Input (Styled Button Trigger)
    - Image Preview
    - Loading Indicator (Spinner)
    - Error Message Box
    - Tabs
    - Cards (Book Recommendations)
    - Header/Footer
- **Iconography (Future):** Consider using a consistent icon library (e.g., Font Awesome, Material Icons, Tabler Icons) for visual cues.
- **Imagery:**
    - Book Covers: Display clearly, handle missing covers gracefully.
    - User Avatars (Future): Placeholder strategy needed.

## 4. Key UI Elements & Flows

- **Upload Flow**: Clear options for file upload vs. camera capture. Obvious preview area. Prominent "Analyze" button.
- **Loading State**: Visual indicator (spinner) on the Analyze button and potentially overlaying the preview/results area during processing.
- **Results Display**: Tabs are effective for separating detected vs. recommended. Book cards should be scannable, showing key info (cover, title, author) prominently.
- **Error Handling**: Non-intrusive but clear error messages explaining the issue (e.g., upload failed, detection failed, API error).

## 5. Future Considerations

- **Component Library**: Formalize reusable React components for consistency and maintainability.
- **Design System**: As complexity grows, establish a more formal design system document.
- **Dark Mode**: Implement a toggle and define dark theme color variables.
- **Animations/Microinteractions**: Add subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience without being distracting.
